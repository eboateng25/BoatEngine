## About
BoatEngine is a Java game development framework based on OpenGL, designed for Windows, Linux and macOS. Started in 2016 the project is still in very early development with a lot more development awaiting to come in the future months. In its current state, the framework is only able to load and render PNG images as well as draw squares with its shape renderer. The plan for this framework is to provide a robust environment for developing 2D games with the plans to also add a game engine allowing beginners to build and design games. It is still in a very early stage with even basic functions such as keyboard support still missing. The project was stopped in development later in 2016 due to focus on other projects but I thought I'd pick it up now with a lot more spare time on my hands.

## What's next?
There is a lot of work that needs to be done on this project at this current moment in time but a list of features that will be completed in due course include:
- Migration to LWGL 3 (The project was built in 2016 and still uses LWJGL 2. As the project is still in earlier stages and migration to LWJGL 3 before further development would be best)
- Transformations
- Controller support (Includes mouse, keyboard, and even controller support)
- Animations
- And some more fun stuff...
